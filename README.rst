Toy Problems
============

This repository contains various solutions to problems from Leetcode.com and
"Cracking the Coding Interview." I have been working on these problems to
prepare for the coding olympics ;)

Each solution was derived using the following process:

  #) Define the environment. Understand constraints

  #) Define examples

  #) Write pseudocode (this is not included in the repo)

  #) Write functional code

  #) Refactor

A quick plug for the Puget Sound Programming Python (PuPPy) group and the
Monday night "Study Group for Cracking the Coding Interview" meetup
that helped me get started.
